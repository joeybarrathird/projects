This project is something I am currently doing in my free time. The aim is to build
a fairly realistic simulation of a grocery store checkout. Currently
this simulation is a rough simulation that randomizes most of the configurable
information, thus providing the "rough" in the simulation. I plan on building more
classes similar to my simSetup class in order to create tailored simulation runs. To do this
I will most likely have the other simSetup classes read files that will contain all the 
configuration information. Furthermore, I plan on adding more more functionality to both the 
Customer class (ex. leave if wait is to long) and the Cashier class (ex. Fatigue and slowing of tpi).

This grocery simulation is ran by iterations through a while loop in the run method of
the simSetup class. Using queues to simulate lines, I do several things per iteration.
Such as, assigning customers to either a cashier (if available) or to a waitingQueue (the line),
checking for availability for customers waiting in line, and whether or not the transaction
between customers and cashiers was completed.
